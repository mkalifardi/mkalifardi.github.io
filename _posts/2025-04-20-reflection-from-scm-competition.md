As a member of the **MBG Team** in the 2025 Victorian Universities Supply Chain Management (SCM) Case Competition, I had the opportunity to work on a bold, forward-thinking strategy for embedding circularity into Australia’s retail and supply chain landscape. Our focus was broad and systems-driven—advocating for scalable, long-term transformations in how major retailers engage with sustainability.

While we are proud of what we built, we also learned a great deal from **CircuLink**, a fellow competitor whose concise and well-targeted proposal won the judges’ favor. This post is a reflection on the differences between our approaches, what I admired about CircuLink’s model, and how I plan to apply these lessons going forward as an aspiring infrastructure and supply chain strategist.

#### 1. Targeted Problems Create Tangible Solutions

CircuLink identified a specific and under-discussed pain point: **shortages and waste of household appliances caused by international student turnover**. Their solution was built around a clear cycle—students arriving in need of appliances, and others leaving with lightly-used items that are often discarded.

They backed this with strong context: 849,000 international students, 41% product stockouts, and excessive landfill waste.

Our MBG Team, by contrast, addressed the **larger structural barriers** to circularity in Australian retail. We aligned our vision with CSIRO’s 2035 national goals and proposed a strategy to embed **circular services**—like repair, resale, PaaS, and reverse logistics—into the core operating models of leading retailers like Wesfarmers and Woolworths.

While our approach was **systemic and policy-aligned**, CircuLink’s user-focused framing made their proposal easier to grasp and more actionable within the scope of the competition.

#### 2. Execution Readiness vs Systemic Vision

CircuLink’s model stood out for its **clarity and feasibility**. Their solution followed a straightforward chain of activities:

- Departing students trade in used appliances  
- Retailers inspect, repair, and refurbish  
- Incoming students purchase affordable, verified second-hand goods  
- Universities and loyalty programs act as catalysts for participation  

It was a model that could be **piloted in a single campus city tomorrow**—and that’s powerful.

We focused on a more transformative shift. Below is one of our key diagrams, mapping how retailers can scale circularity through **product-as-a-service**, repair hubs, resale platforms, and recycling partnerships:

Our concept incorporated digital tools (IoT, AI), design thinking, and new performance metrics to reshape how value is created beyond the point of sale. But its depth may have created a gap between vision and near-term execution.

> **Lesson:** In competitions, strategy must be bold—but **immediately usable**.

#### 3. Stakeholder Engagement: Direct vs Distributed

CircuLink simplified its ecosystem: international students, retailers, and universities. Their diagram clearly mapped out responsibilities and benefits for each player, making the flow intuitive:

- **Students** gain affordability and convenience  
- **Retailers** access new supply and resale revenue  
- **Universities** enable trade-in promotion and collection  

In our model, we explored a **broader web of influence**—governments, corporate strategy teams, product designers, and repair technicians. The slide below shows how we envisioned multi-level collaboration for circular transition:

While comprehensive, our stakeholder view may have felt abstract, especially compared to the personal relevance of CircuLink’s pitch.

> **Lesson:** Sometimes, **less is more**—especially when every actor’s role is crystal clear.

#### 4. Storytelling and Presentation

CircuLink used **minimal slides, clean visuals**, and a single model diagram that immediately conveyed their process. Their storytelling was tight, focused, and easy to remember.

We invested in **detailed research and academic alignment**. Our presentation incorporated industry case studies, journal-backed trends, and best practices from global circular leaders. Below is our final summary slide:

Looking back, we might have improved our pitch by focusing more on **visual storytelling** and narrative simplicity, rather than overwhelming with information density.

> **Lesson:** Even the best ideas need **clarity of communication** to resonate.

#### 5. Final Reflection

This experience has been invaluable. I’m deeply proud of the MBG Team for pushing the boundaries of what retail circularity could look like in Australia. We brought systems innovation, academic rigor, and strategic foresight to the table.

At the same time, CircuLink reminded me that **real-world impact often begins with small, focused interventions**. Their success came from connecting a clearly defined problem with a practical, well-structured solution that could scale over time.

### Takeaways I’ll carry forward:
- Frame complex issues through **human-centered design**
- Combine **vision with actionability**
- Communicate through **stories, not just strategies**

To the organizers, mentors, and competing teams—thank you. This case competition didn’t just challenge us; it made us better.
