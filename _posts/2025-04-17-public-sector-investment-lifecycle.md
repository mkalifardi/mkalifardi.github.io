When governments invest in infrastructure—hospitals, transport systems, digital services—it’s not just about pouring concrete or upgrading servers. It’s about solving public problems, creating long-term value, and making difficult trade-offs under limited resources.

But how do we know **what’s worth funding**? Or whether a proposal is even **needed** in the first place?

This is where the **Investment Lifecycle Guidelines (ILG)** come in—a decision-making framework used by the Victorian Government to assess, prioritize, and manage public investment. In this post, I’ll unpack the **first two phases** of the lifecycle: **Strategic Assessment** and **Options Analysis**.

#### Phase 1: Strategic Assessment — Ask the Right Question First

> _"Don’t start with a solution. Start with a problem."_

Too often in the public sector (and in business), investments are shaped by assumptions rather than needs. Strategic Assessment flips the script. It asks:

- What is the actual **service gap or problem**?
- How does this align with broader **government policy**?
- What are the expected **outcomes** for the public?

At this stage, the focus is not on the **asset** (e.g., a building or system), but on the **logic** behind the investment.

##### Key Tools:
- **Investment Logic Map (ILM):** A one-page model showing the cause-effect relationship between the problem, expected benefits, and a conceptual solution.
- **Problem & Benefit Workshops:** Short, focused workshops with investors and delivery teams to articulate needs, risks, and outcomes.
- **Benefit Management Plan (BMP):** A document linking outcomes to clear, measurable KPIs.

##### Why It Matters:
> You can’t manage what you haven’t clarified.

A weak strategic assessment leads to wasted money—even if a project is “delivered on time.” This phase ensures that every investment begins with **intentionality** and **public value** in mind.

#### Phase 2: Options Analysis — Explore Before You Commit

> _"There are always more ways to solve a problem than you think."_

Once you’ve clarified the need, the next question is: **how best to solve it?**

Options Analysis is about broad thinking before narrow decisions. It avoids the trap of assuming the first (or loudest) solution is the right one.

##### What’s Explored:
- **Asset vs Non-Asset Solutions:** Could a policy change or partnership work instead of building something new?
- **Scale & Scope:** Should the solution be small and flexible or large and future-proof?
- **Delivery Models:** Traditional procurement vs Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) or project alliancing?
- **Timing, Location, and Staging:** Is now the best time? Can it be staged? Where’s the highest impact?

##### Evaluation Criteria:
- Strategic fit and urgency
- Cost-benefit performance
- Risk and uncertainty
- Lifecycle costs (not just capital)
- Alignment with other public initiatives

##### Why It Matters:
> A well-framed options analysis often reveals that the **best solution is not the most expensive one.**

This phase saves public money by **screening poor options early**—before the business case burns time and budget.

#### Deeper Insight: What We Often Get Wrong

1. **Solution-Led Thinking:** We chase new buildings or shiny tech before clarifying why they’re needed.
2. **Poor Problem Framing:** If stakeholders don’t agree on the problem, they won’t agree on the fix.
3. **Lack of Alternatives:** When only one option is presented, decision-makers can't assess trade-offs.
4. **Siloed Planning:** Without early coordination, we risk duplicated effort and fragmented public outcomes.

#### Summary: From Logic to Leverage

| Phase               | Purpose                                      | Tools Used                           |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Strategic Assessment | Define the business need and public value     | ILM, Benefit Management Plan         |
| Options Analysis     | Explore and compare delivery options          | Cost-benefit tools, Option Ranking   |

Together, these two phases ensure that **investments are worth doing** before deciding **how** to do them.
