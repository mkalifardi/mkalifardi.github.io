Welcome to the first post on **mnote** 🧠!

This site is my digital notebook — a second brain where I capture ideas, learnings, and reflections on what I’m working on and curious about.

I decided to build it because I want to:

- ✍️ Document lessons from working on capital and infrastructure projects  
- 🛣️ Explore transport systems and mobility challenges  
- 💰 Understand project finance, evaluation, and investment decisions  
- 🧠 Sharpen my thinking through writing and reflection

Everything here is a work in progress.  
This isn’t a polished portfolio — it’s a thinking space.

Thanks for reading — and welcome to the journey.
