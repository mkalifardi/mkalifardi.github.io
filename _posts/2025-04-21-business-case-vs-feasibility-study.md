One of the most common questions I get from fellow infrastructure professionals in Indonesia is:

> _‚ÄúIs a Business Case the same thing as a Feasibility Study?‚Äù_

The short answer: **Not exactly‚Äîbut they are closely related.**

Let‚Äôs explore what a Business Case is in the context of the **Victorian Government‚Äôs Investment Lifecycle**, and how it compares to what we call a *Studi Kelayakan* in Indonesia.

#### What is a Business Case?

In the **third phase** of the Investment Lifecycle (after Strategic Assessment and Options Analysis), the Business Case builds a **comprehensive justification** for an investment proposal. It‚Äôs not just about proving feasibility‚Äîit‚Äôs about proving **value**.

##### Its Core Purpose:
- Show that the **preferred option** (from Options Analysis) meets the service need.
- Demonstrate that the project is **fundable**, **deliverable**, and **aligned with public value**.
- Present a case strong enough for approval from bodies like the **Expenditure Review Committee (ERC)**.

##### What It Includes:
- Detailed economic and financial analysis (NPV, cost-benefit, lifecycle cost)
- Risk and procurement strategy
- Stakeholder impact analysis
- Delivery timelines and governance structure
- Clear benefit realization plan with KPIs

> üí° Think of it as a document to convince government decision-makers: ‚ÄúThis is the right investment, at the right time, for the right reasons.‚Äù

#### What About Feasibility Studies in Indonesia?

In Indonesia, a *Studi Kelayakan Proyek* is required for infrastructure projects‚Äîespecially those involving public-private partnerships (KPBU), SOEs, or regional government funding.

It usually focuses on:
- Technical feasibility
- Market demand
- Environmental and legal clearance
- Economic and financial metrics (IRR, B/C ratio)
- Risk and sensitivity analysis

This overlaps significantly with what is included in a **Business Case**, but there are a few differences.

#### Key Differences

| Feature                       | Business Case (Victoria, Australia)           | Feasibility Study (Indonesia)                 |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Objective                    | Strategic justification and public value      | Technical, market, and financial viability    |
| Audience                     | Government decision-makers (ERC, Treasury)    | Investors, ministries, and procurement teams  |
| Policy Alignment             | Strong alignment with whole-of-government     | Often more project-specific or sectoral       |
| Benefit Tracking             | Includes KPIs, benefit realisation plans      | Rarely includes post-implementation tracking  |
| Procurement Model            | Suggests model (PPP, alliance, traditional)   | Often technical recommendation only           |
| Use in Budget Process        | Essential for funding decisions               | Sometimes used after project has approval     |

#### So Are They the Same?

Not quite. A **Feasibility Study** can be considered a **subset** of a comprehensive **Business Case**.

- If you're working in Indonesia: start with the Feasibility Study.
- If you're working with international stakeholders or policy-focused governments: expect to **expand** that study into a full **Business Case** with policy, governance, and stakeholder logic.

---

#### Why This Matters

Many Indonesian infrastructure projects fail to move forward‚Äînot because they're technically flawed, but because the **strategic case isn‚Äôt strong enough**.

Without a full Business Case:
- Projects may lack stakeholder buy-in.
- Risks are underestimated.
- Benefits aren‚Äôt clearly defined or measurable.

If Indonesia begins adopting a Business Case approach, especially for nationally strategic projects, we may see better governance, reduced waste, and more **value-for-money** outcomes.

#### Summary

| Term              | Business Case                        | Feasibility Study                  |
|------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Scope            | Broad (strategic + financial)        | Technical + financial              |
| Use              | Decision-making + budget approval    | Project validation + risk control  |
| Best For         | Whole-of-government investment logic | Engineering and investment proof   |
