title: "Indonesia’s Position in the Post-Global Trade Era"

As global trade transitions from a rules-based system to one shaped by strategic friction and political alignment, Indonesia finds itself at a pivotal crossroads. The return of protectionist measures — especially from large economies like the U.S. — has forced many countries to rethink their positioning. But Indonesia’s recent responses raise deeper questions about its long-term industrial vision, regulatory integrity, and policy fairness.

## 🌍 The Shifting Global Trade Landscape

2025 marks a clear departure from the free trade paradigm that defined the post-WTO decades. Tariffs, industrial policy, and “friend-shoring” have replaced efficiency and openness as the logic behind trade.

- The **U.S. proposes universal 10% import tariffs** and sector-specific duties
- The **EU advances carbon border adjustments and digital regulations**
- **China accelerates regional trade frameworks** through RCEP and Belt & Road corridors

Countries are no longer competing only on cost or access — but on strategic alignment, self-reliance, and security.

## 🇮🇩 Indonesia’s Response: Tactical or Short-Sighted?

Rather than asserting a clear industrial position, Indonesia appears to be negotiating ad hoc — attempting to stay "neutral" in a polarized system.

Recent signals suggest that Indonesia may:

- **Increase oil and gas imports** to appeal to foreign energy partners — a move that may inflate domestic prices and disproportionately hurt lower-income communities.
- **Disband local content requirements (TKDN)** — a foundational policy that had previously helped grow local manufacturing and ensured knowledge transfer from multinational partners.

> These are not trade concessions — they are **structural reversals**. And the cost may be far greater than any temporary tariff exemption or diplomatic favor.

## 🧩 The Risks of Sacrificing Policy Integrity

Indonesia’s posture risks sending three dangerous messages:

### 1. **Regulations are fluid and negotiable**
Multinational companies that previously complied with strict TKDN rules may now face competitors who didn’t — eroding fairness and damaging trust in Indonesia as a predictable investment destination.

### 2. **Investors can’t rely on long-term policy**
Infrastructure and energy investments often have 10–30 year horizons. Policy reversals mid-cycle increase perceived risk and may raise the cost of capital or deter strategic investors altogether.

### 3. **Public costs are externalized**
Removing safeguards like domestic content or energy pricing mechanisms may shift the burden onto citizens — through higher prices, lost jobs, or reduced national capabilities.

> Indonesia’s approach may help in the short term — but without legal certainty and consistent industrial direction, it risks **digging its own grave** in a post-global world.

## 🔍 What’s Missing: A National Value Proposition

Countries like India, Vietnam, and Mexico are responding to trade realignment by clarifying their **strategic offers**: logistics hubs, semiconductor clusters, or energy corridors.

Indonesia, by contrast, is in danger of becoming:

- Too large to be agile
- Too fragmented to be consistent
- Too reactive to shape its own destiny

It needs to define — and defend — a **national value proposition** grounded in:
- Long-term industrial strategy
- Regulatory fairness
- Fiscal and legal predictability

## 🏭 Flight of Industry: Manufacturers Are Leaving

Indonesia’s lack of regulatory certainty isn’t just a theoretical issue — it’s already triggering **capital flight** in real sectors like **textiles and light manufacturing**.

Many companies, particularly in the **garment and textile industry**, are moving their production facilities to **Vietnam, Bangladesh, and even Latin America**, citing:

- **Ketidakpastian hukum (legal uncertainty)** — policies often change with little notice, lacking transparency or judicial recourse.
- **Criminalisation of business actors** — legal tools are often used arbitrarily to pressure, punish, or silence companies over compliance issues.
- **Pungutan liar (illegal levies)** — systemic extortion and unofficial payments demanded by:
  - Grassroots operatives (preman)
  - Local community groups (ormas)
  - Lower-level bureaucrats and village-level officials

> These "informal costs" — difficult to quantify but impossible to avoid — make doing business in Indonesia unpredictable and unattractive.

As a result:
- Manufacturers are **shutting down Indonesian operations**
- Tens of thousands of factory workers are being laid off, especially in West Java and Central Java
- Investors are redirecting expansion capital to **jurisdictions with better contract enforcement, fewer middlemen, and stronger labor stability**

Indonesia isn't losing to cheaper labor — it's losing to **governance systems that are clearer, faster, and fairer.**

This loss of industrial base has long-term consequences:
- Eroded local supply chains
- Reduced export capacity
- Lower foreign exchange earnings
- Weakened manufacturing capability for infrastructure delivery (e.g. steel, cement, textiles for labor uniforms, PPE, etc.)

> Without systemic reform, Indonesia risks becoming a **resource exporter and importer of finished goods** — repeating the post-colonial pattern it once tried to escape.

## 🧠 Final Thought

Indonesia can’t control global tariffs — but it can control its **credibility, consistency, and clarity**. That’s what long-term investors — and citizens — care about most.

> In a world where trade rules are being rewritten, Indonesia must decide whether to be a price taker or a rule shaper.
