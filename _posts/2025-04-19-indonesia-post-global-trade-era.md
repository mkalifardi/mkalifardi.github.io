As global trade transitions from a rules-based system to one shaped by strategic friction and political alignment, Indonesia finds itself at a pivotal crossroads. The return of protectionist measures — especially from large economies like the U.S. — has forced many countries to rethink their positioning. But Indonesia’s recent responses raise deeper questions about its long-term industrial vision, regulatory integrity, and policy fairness.

#### The Shifting Global Trade Landscape

2025 marks a clear departure from the free trade paradigm that defined the post-WTO decades. Tariffs, industrial policy, and “friend-shoring” have replaced efficiency and openness as the logic behind trade.

- The **U.S. proposes universal 10% import tariffs** and sector-specific duties
- The **EU advances carbon border adjustments and digital regulations**
- **China accelerates regional trade frameworks** through RCEP and Belt & Road corridors

Countries are no longer competing only on cost or access — but on strategic alignment, self-reliance, and security.

#### Indonesia’s Response: Tactical or Short-Sighted?

Rather than asserting a clear industrial position, Indonesia appears to be negotiating ad hoc — attempting to stay "neutral" in a polarized system.

Recent signals suggest that Indonesia may:

- **Increase oil and gas imports** to appeal to foreign energy partners — a move that may inflate domestic prices and disproportionately hurt lower-income communities.
- **Disband local content requirements (TKDN)** — a foundational policy that had previously helped grow local manufacturing and ensured knowledge transfer from multinational partners.

> These are not trade concessions — they are **structural reversals**. And the cost may be far greater than any temporary tariff exemption or diplomatic favor.

#### The Risks of Sacrificing Policy Integrity

Indonesia’s posture risks sending three dangerous messages:

##### 1. **Regulations are fluid and negotiable**
Multinational companies that previously complied with strict TKDN rules may now face competitors who didn’t — eroding fairness and damaging trust in Indonesia as a predictable investment destination.

##### 2. **Investors can’t rely on long-term policy**
Infrastructure and energy investments often have 10–30 year horizons. Policy reversals mid-cycle increase perceived risk and may raise the cost of capital or deter strategic investors altogether.

##### 3. **Public costs are externalized**
Removing safeguards like domestic content or energy pricing mechanisms may shift the burden onto citizens — through higher prices, lost jobs, or reduced national capabilities.

> Indonesia’s approach may help in the short term — but without legal certainty and consistent industrial direction, it risks **digging its own grave** in a post-global world.

#### What’s Missing: A National Value Proposition

Countries like India, Vietnam, and Mexico are responding to trade realignment by clarifying their **strategic offers**: logistics hubs, semiconductor clusters, or energy corridors.

Indonesia, by contrast, is in danger of becoming:

- Too large to be agile
- Too fragmented to be consistent
- Too reactive to shape its own destiny

It needs to define — and defend — a **national value proposition** grounded in:
- Long-term industrial strategy
- Regulatory fairness
- Fiscal and legal predictability

#### Flight of Industry: Manufacturers Are Leaving

Indonesia’s lack of regulatory certainty isn’t just a theoretical issue — it’s already triggering **capital flight** in real sectors like **textiles and light manufacturing**.

Many companies, particularly in the **garment and textile industry**, are relocating production to **Vietnam and other Southeast Asian countries**, citing:

- **Ketidakpastian hukum (legal uncertainty)** — policy inconsistencies and opaque enforcement mechanisms.
- **Criminalisation of business actors** — where regulatory tools are weaponized for rent-seeking or coercion.
- **Pungutan liar (illegal levies)** — systemic extortion and unofficial fees imposed by:
  - Local thugs (preman)
  - Ormas (community organizations)
  - Village-level officials and low-ranking bureaucrats

> These "informal costs" — difficult to measure but deeply embedded — make Indonesia a high-friction environment for doing business.

As a result:
- Textile manufacturers are **shutting down Indonesian operations**
- Tens of thousands of factory workers have lost jobs, especially in West and Central Java
- Expansion capital is being redirected toward countries with **stronger legal protection, clearer contract enforcement, and fewer layers of middlemen**

Indonesia is not losing to cheaper labor — it’s losing to **governance systems that are cleaner, faster, and more stable**.

#### The Missed Opportunity: Insight from the Global South

Indonesia has long hoped to capitalize on the U.S.–China trade rift by positioning itself as an alternative manufacturing hub. But as noted by [Rakhmat and Purnama](https://chinaglobalsouth.com/analysis/indonesias-manufacturing-gamble-turning-trade-wars-into-economic-opportunity/), the strategy so far suffers from a lack of coherence.

Key takeaways:

- Indonesia cannot **copy-paste Vietnam’s model** — its industrial base, labor dynamics, and administrative capacity differ significantly.
- Rather than leveraging trade wars as a launchpad for strategic reform, Indonesia risks **undermining its own industrial ecosystem** through ad hoc deregulation and reactive policymaking.
- Offering tariff concessions and removing local content rules **may attract short-term headlines**, but they jeopardize long-term investor trust — especially among firms that **already complied with older, stricter rules**.

The deeper problem isn’t just external policy — it’s internal governance:
- A legal system perceived as unstable
- Local governments applying rules inconsistently
- Investment promotion agencies disconnected from policy enforcement

> Indonesia isn’t suffering from lack of opportunity — it’s suffering from **lack of internal coherence** and **policy follow-through**.

---

#### Final Thought

Indonesia can’t control global tariffs — but it can control its **credibility, consistency, and clarity**. That’s what long-term investors — and citizens — care about most.

> In a world where trade rules are being rewritten, Indonesia must decide whether to be a price taker, a rule shaper — or worse, a cautionary tale.
