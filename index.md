Welcome to **mnote**  
This site is my personal knowledge base â€” a second brain where I capture ideas, notes, and reflections from my professional work and ongoing learning.

I work at the intersection of:

- Capital projects and infrastructure delivery  
- Toll road and mining project development  

Currently, I'm exploring and building knowledge in:

- Transport systems and urban mobility  
- Finance, economics, and project valuation  
- Data-driven planning and strategic decision-making
